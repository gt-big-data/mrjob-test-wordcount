This is for users to test their EMR credentials and get started with MRJob, EMR, and S3.
This is code from [the wiki](https://github.com/gt-big-data/wiki/wiki/AWS-Info#using-emr-with-mrjob)

## Starting
install mrjob with `pip install mrjob`

## Run locally
`python word_count.py sherlock-holmes.txt`

Should give a lot of job info, and then finally
```
    "chars"	549698
    "lines"	12649
    "words"	104493
```

## Run In The Cloud
Things you need from us
  1. AWS access key + AWS secret access key. We distribute these in a CSV file for your account.
  2. A password to access your account

Things you need to do:
  1. [Create an EC2 key pair](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gettingstarted/latest/wah/getting-started-create-key-pair.html), and download it to your machine. Make sure to run `chmod 400 *myKeyPair.pem*`
    1. [Make sure your URL Has ?region=us-east-1](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-east-1#KeyPairs) or everything will be messed up! The `.mrjob.conf` file assumes you are using a us-east-1 key pair! :)
  2. Fill in the `.mrjob.conf` file with your access key, secret access token, key pair name, and key pair path.

  A fake example of what this might look like in your `.mrjob.conf` with user bob who created the key-pair bob.pem and stored it in his configs folder

```
    aws_access_key_id: AJVLKDFAHVKNMLDFSFAJ
    aws_secret_access_key: JVMAKLA+++/fdakjlIEQLjvAL
    ec2_key_pair: bob
    ec2_key_pair_file: /home/bob/configs/bob.pem 
```

   3. Put this `.mrjob.conf` file **in your home directory**. `mv .mrjob.conf ~/`
   4. Run the job:   
```
python word_count.py -r emr s3://gt-big-data-club/mrjob-test-wordcount/sherlock-holmes.txt --output-dir=s3://gt-big-data-club/mrjob-test-wordcount/out --no-output
```
This will spin up an instance to run your job, and word count a copy of sherlock holmes we uploaded to s3 previously.
It takes about 90 seconds to spin up the instances, and then another minute or something to run the job. You can always look at the job running from the "elastic map reduce" part of your aws console after logging in.
